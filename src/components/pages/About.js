      <p>
        I love solving problems, and coding offers me a
        cost-effective approach to implementing solutions to
        real-world challenges. I am building the competency to
        develop professional-grade web applications for anyone
        needing such a service. I am a team player because I
        accept that an individual can go fast alone, but a team
        can go far together. In any organization, I strive to
        advance its cause through my service.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love movies, music, computer games, chess, checkers,
        and sightseeing. If you are up for some fun, you can
        reach out for a game of chess.
      </p>
